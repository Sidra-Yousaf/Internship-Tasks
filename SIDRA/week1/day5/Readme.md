                                         Week-1: Day-5
                  
Today, I successfully designed cards using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. I used Flexbox properties to adjust the card direction and added a filter to the images for opacity. The cards are designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices. 
Note: Design screen size starts from 2500.
