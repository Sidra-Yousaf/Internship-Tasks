Today, I learned how to install Node.js using NVM, allowing me to easily switch between different Node.js versions for project compatibility. I also learned how to create a React app using the command-line terminal and install the "react-router-dom" library for routing. I explored passing data between components using props, including arrays and objects as initial state values. Additionally, I discovered how to use the useRef hook to access HTML elements in my code. I implemented adding todos, marking them as complete, and displaying the remaining number of unmarked todos. Finally, I added a clear button to remove all todos.
