                      How we can apply validations using Joi library.
                      How we can use POST method, how we can create data using POST.
                      How we can use PUT method to update the data.
                      And Finally in last how we can delete data using Delete Method
                      NOTE: We have passed the data using array and objects. we did not
                      use the db.
